# Experimental-Design

9/2/2017
To do list:

# Important
- Parsing
  - Jonas to finish some final parts
  - Need to finalise sampling from post with Juliane
  - Scott to combine all elements of parsing once Jonas is done
  - Scott to do local code and input.xml files
  
- CUDA-sim
  - Leander to combine first CUDA-sim function after Scott has finished with parsing
  - Tidy up output for CUDA-sim
    - Using 5D output
  - Jonas to add attributes to model object
  - Pickle object after correct trajectories assigned to each experiment

- GPU stuff
  - Leander to finish launch configuration
    - Looking at block shape
    - Scott to look at calculating block shape
  
# Not as important
- Tidy and improve Python and CUDA
  - Commenting code
  - Improving speed
  - Scott to see if improvements can be made to current kernel
  - Scott to see if summation improvements can be made
  - Runnable on both Python 2 and 3

- Improve CUDA-sim implementation

- Julia wrapper

- Presentation of results
  - Terminal output
    - Log file
  - Graphs

- Group report
  - Discuss what each individual writes
  - What is included
  
- Stochastic implementation (potential publication)
  - Change CUDA-sim accordingly

- Error-checking
  - To be done at the end
